# Story
You take the pill and fade away...<br>
What color was it? Don't remember...
Your vision clears.<br>
The fun starts.<br>

Story takes place in a post-apocalyptic city where someone, called the Maker, has created color coded pills that send the user off into vivid themed dreams. The color dictates the type of dream you will have. Blue = adventure, pink = porno, purple = fantasy themed adventure, green = Sci-fi themed adventure, red = romance story, etc. All these pills take you away from the horror and lawlessness that is day to day life. People start to realize that they go mad if they take too many. There are rumors that the Maker has made a multicolored pill that either cures this madness or kills you in the process.

# Why I'm making this
I'm making this to test my Javascript skills. It will be made up of vanilla JS. Also for Hacktoberfest!

In case you ever wanted to know my journey - read on! I've been coding since I was a kid. I got interested in web developement by messing around with my profile page on Neopets back in middle school. It didn't really go anywhere until I got to college. I wanted to get a CS degree but I deceded against it since I was hearing horror stories of people with CS degrees that never found jobs. I was poor af and needed a job asap so I found another major that interested me - Lab science! Basically I learned everything I needed to know to work in a clinical laboratory - think of the people that test your blood/other bodily fluids when you go to the ER. It was definitely fun for awhile but I realized I liked to be more hands on and the laboratory I was working in was very automated. In my freetime I started coding again. I started getting pretty serious, thinking I might go back to school and get that CS degree. Life is funny sometimes though and I ended up moving and getting a job as a Biomedical Technician - basically I work on the medical machines now. I still code as a hobby but I am always looking to improve and expand my coding skills. I still consider myself a beginner since my learning has been so inconsistant. Looking forward to using this project as a learning opportunity.
